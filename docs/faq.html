            <p>
                You'll get a personal podcast URL that you can add to the podcast player you already use.

            <h2>Will Paperpod cost money?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, Paperpod will have a affordable subscription.
                Being transparent about how we'll cover expenses means
                we're not having to do shady stuff like selling you data.
                To anyone. Ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                A subscription model also allows for an <a href="https://github.com/olaven/paperpod">open
                    development</a>],
                where anyone can check out Paperpod's source code if they want to :-)
